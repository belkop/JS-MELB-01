GitHub is a platform that:
* Facilitates the sharing and managing of code, making it easy for multiple engineers to collaborate on the same project.
* Hosts files on the Web so you can share the finished product with other people
* Much like Dropbox or Google Drive lets multiple people collaborate on the same document; GitHub allows this for code
* GitHub allows team members to provide feedback on the code, which potentially increases code quality
