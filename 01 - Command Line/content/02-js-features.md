# Features of JavaScript

* __Ease of implementation__ : All you need to do is put your code in the HTML document and tell the browser that it is JavaScript.
* __Offline functionality__ : Because it runs directly on a user's browser, it can still run if they are offline.
* __Immediacy__ : Allows you to create highly responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.
