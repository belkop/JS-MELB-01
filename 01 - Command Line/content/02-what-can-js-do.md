### What can JS do?

* Historically, JavaScript has been a browser-based language used mostly to add interactive elements to web pages like animations, buttons and user input forms on the front-end.  It has evolved to being used to interact with APIs and back-ends, and even perform some traditionally back-end tasks such as rendering HTML, caching, etc.
