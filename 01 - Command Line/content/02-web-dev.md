# Defining the web dev ecosystem

* __Web dev__ : The process of building sites and applications for the web
  * __Front-end dev__ : The development of client / browser code (HTML, CSS, JS), i.e. what the user sees and interacts with.
  * __Back-end dev__ : The development of server-side code that handles things like routing, data handling and databases (Ruby, Python, Java), i.e. the stuff _"behind the scenes"_ that makes web applications work.
