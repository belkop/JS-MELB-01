      <li>In this class, we will be using the popular general-purpose library [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), as well [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating.  We will not be focusing on any particular front-end framework.</li>
      <li>However, we have the option as a class to choose any topic for our wildcard lesson. If we decide to have a deep-dive on a particular framework, that's completely fine.</li>
