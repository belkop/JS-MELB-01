#Git and Github process

GitHub's collaborative process can work many different ways, but this is the most common:

1 - Each GitHub project has a Git repository, or repo. Engineers joining a team start by "cloning" the repo. That is, they copy the Git repo from GitHub's cloud and save it in a local folder.

2 - The main, stable version of the codebase is on the default "branch" in Git, which is called master.
