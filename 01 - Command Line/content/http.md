#HTTP

__HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)__ - Because this is a protocol, it enables communication among various computers and supports an array of network configurations. To make this possible, HTTP assumes very little about a particular system.

HTTP makes it easy for many different computers to talk to each other.
