#Git and Github process

3 - Engineers typically create new branches for certain features or portions of the code they will work on, but we won't be creating branches in this class.

4 - As engineers work on a project, they "add" and "commit" their changes. This establishes a saved version of a project and creates a history of the previous iteration. With these saved versions, engineers are able to revert to an earlier version if an issue arises that cannot be fixed.
