### Homebrew (Mac users only)
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a utility to help you install system packages on Mac.  This will make it quick and easy to install other dependencies we'll need for this class:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Try this to verify it worked:
```
brew -v
```
