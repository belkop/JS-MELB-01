### Install Git
Git is version control software that allows you to track changes to your code over time.  __Git is not the same as Github__ - Github is a company that has built itself around the Git technology.

Follow the steps on github to install git and link your github account - [git install](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

Try this to verify it worked:
```
git --version
```
