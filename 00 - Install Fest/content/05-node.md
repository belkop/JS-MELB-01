### Installing Node.js (via nvm)
It's highly recommended that you use nvm (Node Version Manager)
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
```
Use nvm to install the latest stable version of Node.js, and instruct nvm to use this as the default Node version
```
nvm install stable
nvm alias default stable
```
Install the latest version of npm (Node Package Manager)
```
npm install npm -g
```
