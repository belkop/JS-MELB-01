# Class overview
### Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Makes models of the various concepts in the problem area and applies them. These __models__ ("objects") are given functionality ("methods") that allow them to perform various actions, and each object can also hold information.
* The idea is to make it easier to visualize the program by tying the code to concrete things, which lets you group things logically.
* __Everything is an object__ and every object has methods that allow you to access its functionality.
