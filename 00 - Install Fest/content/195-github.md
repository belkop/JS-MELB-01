### Create a Git account
Github is an online service built around git, the version control system created by Linus Torvalds, the creator or Linux.

We will be using git to distribute all the notes, and for you to track your code in the assignments.

If you do not have an account on git, go and [create one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) now, its free.
