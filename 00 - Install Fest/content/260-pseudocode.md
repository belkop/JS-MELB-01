# Thinking like a programmer
### Pseudocode
* You have to understand how computers follow the instructions you write (code).
* __Pseudocode__ is an outline of the logical flow of the program you want to write, often written in just plain English, that has no concern for the syntactical minutiae of writing code.
* Computers typically execute instructions in order, from top to bottom.  So your pseudocode should reflect this by being a series of explicit instructions.
