### Using a Git client (optional)
If you're unfamiliar with Git and/or the command line, you may want to use a Git client application to help you.  Here are two I can recommend:

* [Github app](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

Again, not required, everything can be done using the command line.
