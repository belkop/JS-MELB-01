### Overview

<a name = "lab"></a>
For today's class you'll be getting your Feedr project set up. Our
feed reader will pull feeds from our favorite blogs. The user will be able to
filter between publications through the dropdown on the header menu.
Clicking/tapping on one of the articles will load a pop up with more
information. The user from that point will be able to either dismiss the
additional information or go to the referenced article.

This will be our first single page app. All of our application views will be
contained in the provided [index.html](../../projects/unit2/) file. Our task, after we pull from the
respective feed APIs, will be to toggle the appropriate classes and content for
the provided site architecture.

You'll give the user the ability to pull from a minimum of three news sources. You can
select the three provided news sources and/or add your own:

- [Mashable: http://mashable.com/stories.json](http://mashable.com/stories.json)
- [Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/top.json](https://www.reddit.com/top.json)
- [Digg: http://digg.com/api/news/popular.json](http://digg.com/api/news/popular.json)

Get started by opening up the [Unit 2 project starter code](../../projects/unit2/).
