/*Create a Checklist:

You'll add the ability to complete tasks in your favorite things list.
Your program must complete the following rules:

- Through jQuery, add a "complete task" link at the end of each to-do item
  (i.e. each "favorite thing").
- When clicked, the link will cross out the current item (hint: add a class to
  the list that sets the text-decoration to strikeout).
- Each new item added by the user needs to also have the "complete task" link at
  the end.
- Bonus: when user completes an item, remove that item from the current list and
  add it to a completed list below. Do not show this list unless the there are
  completed items.
- Bonus 2: add the ability to restore items from the completed list to the first
  list.
