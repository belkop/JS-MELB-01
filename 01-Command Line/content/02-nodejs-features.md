# Node.js features

* __Event-driven, asynchronous architecture__ : Node.js, and JS in general, constructs an event loop to which it can dispatch actions that are executed later.  Certain actions which may take a long time to complete can be executed __asynchronously__, meaning they are dispatched to other services, allowing other actions to continue in the meantime.  
* This is as opposed to a traditional blocking strategy, in which the entire program would need to wait for potentially slow operations to complete.
