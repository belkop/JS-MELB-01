#DNS

Every Internet provider has a cached list of all registered domains and their corresponding IP addresses. So when you type something like “apple.com” into the browser, the browser in essence asks the DNS server, "What is the IP address of the characters ‘apple.com’?" The DNS server responds, "17.172.224.47," and the browser then connects to IP address 17.172.224.47.

The process is similar to using street addresses for finding a house, rather than using Latitude and Longitude coordinates.
