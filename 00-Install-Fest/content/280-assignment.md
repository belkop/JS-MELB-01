# Thinking like a programmer
### Pseudocode exercise
Write the pseudocode for a program for that controls a light that can change color based on user input. Imagine that we have 3 different colored buttons (red, blue and yellow) and __if a user taps one of the colored buttons__ the light changes to the selected color. __If the selected color is tapped again__, the light turns off. You do not have to write any actual JavaScript for this exercise.
