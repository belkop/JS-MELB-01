# Thinking like a programmer
### Pseudocode
Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

Its a way of defining your thoughts and the ordering of steps that need to occur.
Pseudocode can be considered the comments about what the program will do.

Once the Pseudocode is written, you then go and write the actual code after each pseudocode comment.
