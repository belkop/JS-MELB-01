### Installing Node.js

Grab the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) install package and run the installation.

There are four core node components:
- Node.js
- NPM - the node package Manager
- NVM - the node version Manager
- IO.js - allows you to write desktop apps using node

We will only use two of them for now - node and npm.
