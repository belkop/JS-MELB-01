### NodeJS

NodeJS is and environment for running javascript on the server, or from the command line.

A company called Joyent took the javascript engine from Google Chrome - V8 - and wrapped around it a set of system tools to allow it to interact with the file system and network.

Node is great for user facing api servers, system glue services, and i/o intensive api servers.
