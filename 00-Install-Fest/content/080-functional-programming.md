# Class overview
### Functional programming
* Functional programming treats the problem area as a chain of equations ("functions") which are strung together, a progression of definitions which lead to the answer.
* Doesn't save state, just creates methods that accept input to produce output
* __The fundamental unit in functional programming is the function__, which can perform operations as well as produce further functions.
