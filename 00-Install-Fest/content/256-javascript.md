# Thinking like a programmer
### Javascript
Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 10 days.

Standardised by ECMA, and called ECMAscript.

Latest version is es6, which is not fully implemented yet.

JAVASCRIPT !== JAVA

The only thing JavaScript has in common with Java is a little bit of syntax style.
