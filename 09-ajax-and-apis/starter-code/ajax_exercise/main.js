/*

- Refactor the codealong to work with user interaction. In the index.html file
there is a "Get Weather Data" button. When the user clicks the button,
pull data from the provided link (http://api.apixu.com/v1/current.json?key=<key>&q=Melbourne).
Handle the link success and error responses accordingly, displaying results in
console.log() if successful.

- Sign up to http://api.apixu.com/ to get your own API key.

- Separate your logic so that you can use your functions for another user button
click of "Get Custom Data". Interact with the weather API and handle both
success and error scenarios.
