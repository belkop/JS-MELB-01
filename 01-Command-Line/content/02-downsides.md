# Downsides of JavaScript

* __Flaky/fragmented implementations__ : You don’t know what computer is on the receiving end of your web page, you don’t know how busy the computer is with other things and you don’t know if some other JavaScript open in another tab of the browser is grinding things down to a halt.  Also, different browsers have slightly different implementations of the language.
* __Security restrictions__ : Because some JavaScript features can be abused, browser vendors apply restrictions to certain features (eg. launching popup windows, making requests to a different domain, etc).
