# Server-side JavaScript

* Node.js emerges as a solid server-side JS runtime in 2009.  Instead of running only inside your web browser, JS can now run on servers, and your computer.  __Blows the doors open for what's possible with the language__ &ndash; web servers, build tools, database solutions, hardware interfaces, etc.
* JavaScript is already immensely popular and being able to use JS on the back-end gives us the option to use a __single programming language throughout an entire full-stack application__.  Gives rise to the concept of _isomorphic_ code, or code that can run both on the client and on the server.
